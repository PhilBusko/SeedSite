# Seed Site

This seed website is built on Django & React, and has support for backend Jupyter development. 
The purpose of the seed site is to provide the common infrastrucuture for a production ready website.
The seed should be cloned for each new project where it will be used, and is customized from there. 
The backend connects to a postgres database, and is websocket enabled.
A skeleton frontend app is provided, with layouts and common input wrappers. 
The frontend uses [ReactN](https://github.com/charlesStover/reactn) to maintain the global state, because redux is far too much overhead.
